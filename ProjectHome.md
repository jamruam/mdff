## Description ##
This code perform molecular dynamics simulation with simple non-bonding potentials
( Lennard-jones, Buckingham, Morse, Born-Huggins-Meyer, Coulombic, PIM  ).
It permits to calculate electric-field gradient (EFG) in a point charge and dipole approximations using direct and Ewald summation methods.
More details in the manual svn/doc/mdff.tex (not complete yet)

## Why? ##
I'm using Google code to have some external repository to work on this project easily.
Please, let me know if you find major bugs.
